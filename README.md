# PyBlkSim
An Open-Source Model Based Simulator for Discrete-Time Simulations

## Source Code 
Refer to ./pyblksim

## Installation
PyBlkSim is managed in Python Package Index (PyPI). Install using the following command, $pip install pyblksim

# Examples

For examples, refer to the directory ./examples. Refer to Kurian Polachan and Bijeet Basak, "PyBlkSim: An Open-Source Block-Based Discrete-Time Simulator," in *Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Communication Systems & Networks (COMSNETS 2025)*, Bangalore, India, to know more about these example scripts.

## Steps to run the example, example-sources-n-scopes,

First, open a terminal, execute the script using the following command, $python .\example_sources_scope_file.py. The script will pop open three windows displaying sinusoidal, noise and ramp signals. The script will also save these signals in CSV format. To view these signals in a single window file, run the post processing script $python example_fig_generation. The figure is also saved in ./examples/example-sources-n-scopes
